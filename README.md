# Denoising_Autoencoders-PCA

Denoising_Autoencoders-PCA is a project that explores the application of autoencoders and principal component analysis (PCA) for denoising data. Autoencoders are neural networks used for unsupervised learning that aim to reconstruct the input data by compressing it into a lower-dimensional representation. PCA is a statistical technique used for dimensionality reduction.

## Description

The Denoising_Autoencoders-PCA project focuses on using autoencoders and PCA to remove noise from data, helping to improve data quality and enhance subsequent analysis or modeling tasks. The project employs the following steps:

1. Data preprocessing: The input data is preprocessed to prepare it for denoising. This may involve cleaning, normalization, and feature engineering, depending on the specific dataset and objectives.

2. Noise injection: The project introduces artificial noise into the preprocessed data. The noise can simulate real-world scenarios or represent unwanted variations in the data.

3. Autoencoder training: An autoencoder neural network is trained on the noisy data. The autoencoder consists of an encoder that compresses the input data into a lower-dimensional representation and a decoder that reconstructs the original input from the compressed representation. The autoencoder is trained to minimize the reconstruction error.

4. Denoising process: The trained autoencoder is used to denoise new, unseen data. The noisy input is fed into the autoencoder, which processes it through the encoder and decoder. The output of the decoder represents the denoised version of the input data.

5. PCA-based denoising (optional): In addition to autoencoders, the project may incorporate PCA for denoising. PCA is applied to the noisy data to identify the principal components that capture the most significant variations. By selecting a subset of these components, the project reconstructs a denoised version of the input data.

The Denoising_Autoencoders-PCA project offers a flexible and customizable approach to denoising data, leveraging the power of autoencoders and PCA for noise reduction.
